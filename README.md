# EnsouledFront

-This project is specifically made for one of the largest MMORPG games, I played this game throughout my childhood and still do to this day. Prior to joining Ironhack coding bootcamp, I built my first website with two simple calculators, which got me to 1500 users per month, I promised that after the bootcamp once I have better knowledge of JS, I will make a better version out of it.

This version will be able to track players in terms of experience gains on the game with other statistics regarding their account. 

It also includes a page with all the game items, prices, charts etc.

Contains 3 calculators, with experience calculations as my original page website had, able to check what items are profitable for a certain skills as well, in this case (Magic).
